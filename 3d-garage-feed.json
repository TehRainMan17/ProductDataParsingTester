The outer edge of the wheel features a machined groove, about 1\/2\" wide, to add an accent to the wheel. A black FOOSE center cap completes the look of the Legend wheel. With a large diameter and wide open style, the FOOSE Legend wheel shows off brakes very well.

The 22 km track was built in 1920 and became known as one of the toughest and most dangerous tracks in the world. Jacki Stewart went as far as nicknaming the track \"the green hell\". Through the 1950s and early 1970s the Nurburgring was the main venue for the German Grand Prix as part of the F1 World Championship. The new Nurburgring Grand Prix Track, called GP-Strecke was completed in 1984 and has hosted several Grand Prix events.<br><br>The TSW Nurburgring wheel is a one-piece rotary forged aluminum wheel, made to the highest standards of manufacturing. The Nurburgring wheel features seven Y-shaped spokes that extend outwards to the edge of the wheel.&nbsp;Features a Matte Bronze finish that can really complement the exterior of your Mustang. TSW completes the Nurburgring wheel with a matching center cap. An extra thick TSW emblem is used to prevent warping and fading.<br><br>This TSW wheel is manufactured using a highly advanced production technique: Rotary Forging. First, the wheel is molded with a very thick lip section. This lip section is then rolled to form the barrel of the wheel. As the wheel is rolled, the molecular structure of the aluminum is changed which enhances the strength of the alloy. The process allows for a much lighter weight than a regular cast wheel, while increasing the strength. Weight savings is in the outer rim of the wheel which dramatically reduces rotational mass and enhances your Mustang's performance.<br><br>TSW wheels are specific for each application. The widths and offsets were designed so this 20\" x 10\" Nurburgring wheel fits all 2005-2022 Mustangs perfectly. Correct sizing is important for proper fitment. Every TSW wheel is equipped with a special metal centering ring so the wheel fits your Mustang perfectly and vibrations are nonexistent. Although the wheel is lightweight, it is designed to handle the weight of your Mustang and the specific load rating is stamped on the back of the Nurburgring wheel. Also, TSW wheels are specifically designed to be TPMS compatible.<br><br>Every single TSW wheel is put through radial and lateral runout tests as well as balance testing. TSW tolerances are 1\/2 the industry average ensuring precise machining and a wheel that will not cause any vibration issues.<br><br><strong>Specifications:<\/strong><br>- Size: 20\" x 10\"<br>- Lugs: 5x114.3mm (5x4.5\")|<br>- Finish: Matte Bronze<br>- Backspacing: 7.07\"<br>- Offset: +40mm<br>- Center Caps: Included<br><br><strong>Tech Tip:<\/strong> Please see P\/N: W749K-B if you are looking for a complete Wheel and Tire Package with a staggered fitment.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Vehicle Fitment:<\/strong><br> - 2005-2017 V6 Mustangs<br> - 2007-2014 Shelby GT500 Mustangs<br> - 2015-2022 EcoBoost Mustangs<br> - 2005-2022 GT Mustangs<br>- 2012-2013 Boss 302<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Tech Tip:<\/strong><br> - These wheels are not intended for use with 2015+ Shelby GT350\/GT350R or 2020+ Shelby GT500 model Mustangs.<br>- This 20\" wheel will clear all available brake kits found on any of the 2005-2022 Mustang fitment mentioned in this listing.<br><em>*This wheel requires small diameter, tuner style lug nuts.

These bulbs are compact enough to imitate your original halogen units, all while lighting your SN95 Mustang exponentially better. Their ergonomic and compact profile makes install easier and keeps bulb temperatures lower.<\/p>\r\n<p>Oracle V-Series bulbs also feature Active Thermal Regulation (ATR) temperature management. A driver integrated into the bulb can detect if temperatures are climbing toward an upper limit and will reduce voltage to stabilize bulb temperature. This feature prolongs bulb life and doesn&rsquo;t significantly affect brightness levels. Because thermal properties are improved, these lights require no external thermal regulation. The heat sinks, metal ribbons, or cooling fans seen on other LED conversions are all unnecessary with these Oracle lights.<\/p>\r\n<p>The V-Series bulb is also compatible with daytime dimmer light functions and can reduce brightness to 50% in a daytime mode just like a halogen bulb.
